# MineMenu Refabricated

**Note: This project is completely separate from [Girafi's MineMenu mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minemenu) - This is only a very customized port for the Fabric-modloader!**  

**As it has been officially abandoned, I have updated [UltraBlack_'s MineMenuFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minemenufabric) for 1.18.2 and 1.19 as both a personal learning project, and for use in modpacks. I intend to continue updating it in the future. Please report any issues you find. I'll try my best to resolve them. But, understand that I am a total Java newbie.** ~ClockwerkKaiser

MineMenu Refabricated assists you with sending single or multiple chat messages, queuing them, copying text, opening links and even pressing (un)bound keybinds in a simple, yet powerful circular and customizable menu with support for categories.
